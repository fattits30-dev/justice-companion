# Initialize repo with comprehensive CLAUDE.md + Specification-Driven Development

Initialize a new project with comprehensive CLAUDE.md and specification framework.

## Usage
```
/xnew <project_name> [stack]
```

## Examples
```
/xnew vibecoding-web node
/xnew ai-patterns python
/xnew microservice-api go
```

## Parameters
- **PROJECT_NAME**: First word in arguments (default: current folder name)
- **STACK**: Technology stack (choices: `python` | `node` | `go` | `java` | `mixed`; default: `mixed`)

## Execution

Perform the following steps in order:

### Step 1: Safety & Idempotence
- Check for existing files before overwriting
- Create timestamped backups for any existing files (format: `filename.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
- Never overwrite without backup creation

### Step 2: Create Comprehensive CLAUDE.md
Generate CLAUDE.md with Specification-Driven Development methodology:

```markdown
# Project: $PROJECT_NAME
# Stack: $STACK
# Generated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
# Development Methodology: Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

This is the single source of truth for all development standards, conventions, rules, and specifications for this project. Claude Code and other AI assistants should read this file first and follow these guidelines for all operations.

## 📚 Specification-Driven Development

This project follows Specification-Driven Development (SDD) methodology. All features MUST have specifications before implementation.

### AWS Kiro EARS Requirements Pattern
All Requirements Now Follow Official EARS Syntax:

- **Event-Driven**: "When [trigger], the system shall [response]"
- **State-Driven**: "While [precondition], the system shall [response]"
- **Ubiquitous**: "The system shall [response]"
- **Optional Feature**: "Where [feature], the system shall [response]"
- **Unwanted Behavior**: "If [trigger], then the system shall [response]"

The validation tool now shows **100% EARS compliance**

### Specification Coverage Requirements
- Every feature must have corresponding specifications
- Every specification must have corresponding tests
- Minimum spec coverage: 95% of all features
- Spec-to-test mapping: Automated validation required
- **EARS compliance: 100% mandatory for all requirements**

### EARS Validation Rules
🚨 **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**:
- All requirements MUST use exact AWS Kiro EARS syntax with brackets
- No exceptions allowed - 100% compliance required
- Validation tool enforces strict format checking
- Requirements failing EARS format are rejected automatically

**EARS Format Validation Examples**:
✅ CORRECT: "When [user clicks save], the system shall [persist data to database]"
✅ CORRECT: "While [backup is running], the system shall [display progress indicator]" 
✅ CORRECT: "The system shall [authenticate users before access]"
✅ CORRECT: "Where [admin privileges], the system shall [allow user management]"
✅ CORRECT: "If [network timeout occurs], then the system shall [retry 3 times]"

❌ INCORRECT: "User can save data" (not EARS format)
❌ INCORRECT: "System should authenticate" (missing brackets)
❌ INCORRECT: "When user saves, validate" (incomplete structure)

## 🎯 Project Goals & Context
- Primary objective: [Define main goal and success metrics]
- Technical requirements: [Core technical needs and constraints]
- Business objectives: [Business value delivered]
- User value: [What users gain from this system]
- Development methodology: Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

## 📋 Requirements Management

### Requirements Framework (AWS Kiro EARS)
requirement_structure:
  id: "REQ-XXX"
  pattern: "Event-Driven|State-Driven|Ubiquitous|Optional|Unwanted"
  requirement: "MUST follow exact EARS syntax with brackets"
  ears_format_examples:
    - "When [user submits form], the system shall [validate all fields]"
    - "While [user is authenticated], the system shall [display user dashboard]"  
    - "The system shall [encrypt all data at rest]"
    - "Where [premium feature enabled], the system shall [allow advanced analytics]"
    - "If [invalid login attempt], then the system shall [lock account after 3 failures]"
  rationale: "Why this requirement exists"
  acceptance_criteria: "Testable criteria for validation"
  priority: "MVP|ADVANCED"
  ears_compliance: "MANDATORY - 100% compliance required"

### MVP vs Advanced Features
- MVP Features: Core functionality for initial release
- Advanced Features: Enhanced capabilities for future iterations
- Decision Framework:
  - ✅ Include in MVP if: Essential for core workflow
  - ⚠️ Move to Advanced if: Complex edge cases or optimizations

## 💻 Language/Framework Standards - $STACK

[Insert stack-specific standards based on $STACK parameter]

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Specification-Based Testing
# Every specification must have corresponding tests
def test_req_001_ticker_submission():
    """
    Test REQ-001: Ticker Symbol Submission
    Spec: specs/requirements.md#REQ-001
    """
    pass

### Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: Minimum 80% code coverage
- Specification tests: 100% requirement coverage
- Integration tests: All API endpoints and database operations
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys
- Performance tests: Meet targets from specs/performance-benchmarks.md

## 🔐 Security Standards

### Application Security
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- HTTPS only for all endpoints
- Rate limiting on all APIs
- Authentication required for all non-public endpoints
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- CORS properly configured
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- No secrets in code (use environment variables)
- Secure credential storage
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages
1. Specification Validation - Verify all features have specifications
2. Build Stage - Compile and generate artifacts
3. Test Stage - Run all tests including spec compliance
4. Quality Gates - All must pass including spec coverage
5. Documentation Validation - Verify specs are complete
6. Deployment Stage - Blue-green deployment
7. Post-Deployment - Monitor and verify

## 🔄 Git & Version Control

### Branching Strategy
- Trunk-Based Development with short-lived feature branches
- Feature branches: feature/REQ-XXX-description
- Main branch is always deployable

### Commit Standards
- Use Conventional Commits format
- Reference specifications: feat(REQ-001): implement requirement
- Atomic commits (one logical change)

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Specification-Driven Development Process

1. Specification Phase (ALWAYS FIRST)
   - Check specs/requirements.md for existing requirements
   - Write/update EARS-formatted requirements
   - Update specs/design.md with technical approach
   - Break down into tasks in specs/tasks.md

2. Implementation Phase
   - Reference specification in code comments
   - Implement according to specs/design.md
   - Follow task sequence from specs/tasks.md

3. Validation Phase (MANDATORY GATE)
   - Run specification compliance tests
   - **CRITICAL**: ALL tests must pass (100%) before proceeding
   - Validate performance against benchmarks
   - Update specifications if gaps found

### Test-First Development Gate
⚠️ **BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: Before proceeding to the next specification or feature:

1. **Run Tests**: Execute `./scripts/run.sh test` 
2. **Verify 100% Pass Rate**: ALL tests must pass - zero failures allowed
3. **Check Coverage**: Ensure specification coverage meets requirements
4. **Document Results**: Log test results in AI_INTERACTIONS.md

**If ANY test fails:**
- ❌ STOP all development work immediately
- 🔧 Fix failing tests before any new work
- ✅ Re-run tests until 100% pass rate achieved
- 📝 Only then proceed to next specification

This gate ensures each specification is fully validated before moving forward.

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] References correct specification (REQ-XXX)
- [ ] **100% EARS COMPLIANCE VERIFIED** (all requirements use AWS Kiro format)
- [ ] Specification tests added/updated
- [ ] **100% TEST PASS RATE VERIFIED** (blocking requirement)
- [ ] Implementation matches specs/design.md
- [ ] Performance meets specs/performance-benchmarks.md
- [ ] Documentation updated in specs/
- [ ] No unspecified functionality added
- [ ] Test results logged in AI_INTERACTIONS.md
- [ ] EARS validation tool shows 100% compliance

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Required Documentation
- README.md: Project overview
- CLAUDE.md: This file - development standards
- specs/: All specifications (PRIMARY SOURCE)
- AI_INTERACTIONS.md: Clean log of AI-assisted development

### AI Interaction Logging
Keep a clean, readable log in AI_INTERACTIONS.md:

## 2024-01-15 14:30 - Implement ticker validation
**H:** Implement REQ-001 ticker validation from specs
**AI:** Created regex validation with special handling for BRK.A format
**Result:** ✅ Working validation function
**Spec Updated:** Added BRK.A edge case to REQ-001
**Commit:** abc123f

Guidelines:
- Only log significant interactions (not routine questions)
- Keep entries brief and scannable
- Focus on: What was asked → What was done → What changed
- Use ✅ for success, ❌ for failed attempts, ⚠️ for partial success

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

### Working with Claude Code
- ALWAYS start with specifications: Read specs/ before any work
- Reference specifications in prompts: "Implement REQ-001 from specs/requirements.md"
- Follow the methodology: This project uses Specification-Driven Development
- Validate against specs: All AI-generated code must meet specifications
- **ENFORCE TEST GATE**: AI assistants MUST run tests and verify 100% pass before proceeding

### AI Assistant Test Requirements
🚨 **MANDATORY FOR ALL AI ASSISTANTS**:

1. **Validate EARS compliance**: All requirements MUST use AWS Kiro EARS format with brackets
2. **Before implementing new specs**: Run `./scripts/run.sh test` to ensure current state is clean
3. **After any code changes**: Execute `./scripts/run.sh test` immediately  
4. **Verify 100% success**: All tests must pass - no exceptions
5. **Block on failures**: If ANY test fails, stop all work and fix tests first
6. **Document results**: Log test outcomes in AI_INTERACTIONS.md

**AI assistants must refuse to proceed with new specifications if:**
- Requirements are not in proper AWS Kiro EARS format (100% compliance required)
- Current tests are failing
- Test coverage is insufficient
- Test gate has not been satisfied
- EARS validation shows any non-compliant requirements

### Effective Prompts
Template: "I'm implementing [REQ-XXX] from specs/requirements.md. This is an [MVP/ADVANCED] feature with [EARS-PATTERN] pattern. Please help me implement this following specs/design.md architecture. REQUIREMENTS: 1) Ensure requirement uses AWS Kiro EARS format with brackets, 2) Run tests and verify 100% pass before proceeding to next spec, 3) Validate EARS compliance shows 100%."

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Learning from Implementation
When implementation teaches us something new:
1. Log it - Brief entry in AI_INTERACTIONS.md
2. Update spec - Add to specs/ with date marker
3. Test it - Add test for new understanding
4. Commit it - Clear commit message with spec reference

### Review Cycles
- Daily: Review current task against specifications
- Weekly: Update specs based on implementation learnings
- Sprint: Comprehensive specification review
- Quarterly: Major specification refactoring

---

Last Updated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Version: 1.0.0
Methodology: Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

⚠️ CRITICAL: This document enforces Specification-Driven Development. All features MUST have specifications in the specs/ directory BEFORE implementation. No code without specs!
```

### Step 3: Create Specifications Directory
Create specs/ directory with essential templates:

```bash
mkdir -p specs/
```

Create specs/README.md with specification guide.
Create specs/requirements.md with EARS template.
Create specs/design.md with architecture template.
Create specs/tasks.md with implementation roadmap template.
Create other specification files as needed.

### Step 4: Generate .gitignore
Create stack-specific .gitignore based on $STACK parameter.

### Step 5: Create Directory Structure & Scripts
```bash
mkdir -p src tests/unit tests/integration tests/e2e tests/specs
mkdir -p docs/api docs/architecture docs/guides
mkdir -p scripts config ci
mkdir -p .claude/commands .claude/hooks .claude/knowledge
touch AI_INTERACTIONS.md
```

Create stack-specific automation scripts in `scripts/` directory:

**For Python Stack:**
Create `scripts/run.sh` as the unified automation script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Python Project Automation Script
# Usage: ./scripts/run.sh [command] [args...]

set -e
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(dirname "$SCRIPT_DIR")"
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"

Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run.sh
```

### Step 6: Create README.md
Generate project README with SDD focus and specification references.

### Step 7: Git Commit
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "init: SDD framework with CLAUDE.md and specifications via /xnew"
```

### Step 8: Final Output
```
✅ Repository initialized with Specification-Driven Development framework

Created:
- CLAUDE.md with SDD methodology and stack-specific standards
- specs/ directory with EARS templates and starter content
- scripts/run.sh - unified automation script for all operations
- AI_INTERACTIONS.md for logging AI-assisted development
- tests/specs/ for specification compliance testing
- Complete directory structure with configurations

Key Features:
✓ Specification-Driven Development enforced
✓ **AWS Kiro EARS requirements format with 100% compliance**
✓ EARS validation tool ensures perfect format compliance
✓ AI interaction logging with timestamps
✓ Specification evolution from discoveries
✓ Unified automation via scripts/run.sh
✓ Stack-specific tooling and standards

Automation Commands (via scripts/run.sh):
📦 ./scripts/run.sh setup      - Install venv, Python 3.11, dependencies
🧪 ./scripts/run.sh test       - Run tests with coverage
✨ ./scripts/run.sh quality    - Linting, formatting, type checking
🔒 ./scripts/run.sh security   - Security scans with bandit/safety  
🏗️ ./scripts/run.sh build      - Build project artifacts
🚀 ./scripts/run.sh deploy     - Full deployment pipeline
⚡ ./scripts/run.sh dev        - Start development server
🎭 ./scripts/run.sh act [event] - Run GitHub Actions with nektos/act
🧹 ./scripts/run.sh clean      - Clean generated files

Next steps:
1. Run: ./scripts/run.sh setup (installs everything you need)
2. Write initial requirements in specs/requirements.md
3. Create technical design in specs/design.md  
4. Run: ./scripts/run.sh test (validates your setup)
5. Begin implementation following specifications
6. Use ./scripts/run.sh act to test GitHub Actions locally

Remember: 
- ALWAYS check specs/ before implementing!
- **ENSURE 100% AWS Kiro EARS compliance with brackets!**
- USE ./scripts/run.sh for all operations!
- **RUN TESTS and verify 100% pass before next spec!**
- LOG significant AI interactions!
- UPDATE specs when you learn something new!

The scripts/run.sh is your single entry point for:
✅ Python 3.11 virtual environment management
✅ Dependency installation and updates  
✅ Running tests, linting, security scans
✅ Building, deploying, and development workflows
✅ Local GitHub Actions testing with nektos/act
✅ Proper virtual environment cleanup

🚨 **CRITICAL TEST GATE**:
- Before implementing new specs: `./scripts/run.sh test`
- ALL tests must pass (100%) - zero failures allowed
- AI assistants MUST enforce this gate
- Block all work if tests fail until fixed
