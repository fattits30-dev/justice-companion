## Configuration Notes

### Settings Hierarchy
Settings are applied in this order (later overrides earlier):
1. User settings: `~/.claude/settings.json`
2. Project settings: `.claude/settings.json` 
3. Local settings: `.claude/settings.local.json`

### Security Considerations
- Always review webhook URLs before using
- Set appropriate file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.claude/settings.json`
- Store sensitive settings in environment variables, not directly in JSON
- Use `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal settings in team projects

### Customization
These templates are starting points. Customize based on your needs:
- Add/remove allowed tools
- Adjust timeout values
- Configure additional hooks
- Set team-specific environment variables

### Validation
Use the validation script to check your configuration:
```bash
./validate-commands.sh --check-settings
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Commands not working**: Check `allowedTools` array includes required tools
2. **Hooks not running**: Verify executable permissions and file paths
3. **Timeouts**: Increase timeout values for slow operations
4. **Permissions errors**: Check file permissions on settings.json and hooks

### Getting Help
- Run `./verify-setup.sh` to diagnose issues
- Check Claude Code logs: `~/.claude/logs/`
